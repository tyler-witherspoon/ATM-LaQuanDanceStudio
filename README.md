Laquan's Dance Studio is in Jackson, Tennessee and offers a variety of dance classes to the public. Our website is meant to serve as a means of learning more about the studio.

Our website has an orange-blue-black theme throughout, requested as such by the commissioner to be parallel to the company's own color scheme. 

The general design layout, from top to bottom, is as follows: site header, navigation, descriptive text, image(s), and copyright.

The background is consistently a goldenrod to dark goldenrod gradient. The main text is black and uses the Times New Roman font.

Typically, in the mobile site, the navigation is in large block form for ease of access, with the main section underneath. These sections vary between pages, but usually consist of descriptive text, a table, a picture, or a combination of these. Links throughout are always marked by the black background, light grey border, and light blue text. The simplicity allows for ease of understanding. On larger devices, the site remains largely the same, except for some navigation changes, such as a horizontal navigation bar on the homepage.

We hope you enjoy reviewing our website.
